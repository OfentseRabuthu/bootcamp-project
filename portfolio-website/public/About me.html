        <h1>About me.</h1>
        <p>Born and raised in the ever so busy city of Pretoria,Gauteng, I developed a strong sense of empathy and a desire to help those in need from a young age. 
            As i grew up, i became acutely aware of the injustices and systemic issues faced by marginalized communities, particularly within our legal system. 
            This fueled my determination to pursue a career in law and to use my knowledge and skills to drive positive change.<br><br>
            I decided to further my education and enrolled for an LLB degree at Unisa, although this has taken a back seat this year due to financial constraints and me taking a different path of web development has not changed my views. 
            My passion still lies in using the law as a tool for social justice.<br>
            Through volunteer work, I have gained hands-on experience in various legal settings, including working with organizations that provide legal aid to under served communities, I have realised that there is a need for legal assistance within such communities.<br><br>
            With my sights set on becoming a qualified lawyer, I am determined to use my legal expertise to make a meaningful impact. I am particularly interested in helping those who have been unfairly accused and ensuring that fathers have equal access to their children. 
            With a deep understanding of the legal system and a strong belief in the power of advocacy, I believe that i am well-equipped to take on these challenges and to embark on my journey to create a more just and equitable society.
